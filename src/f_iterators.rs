//! This portion of the exam tests your abilities to work with iterators and their functional-style
//! methods.
//!
//! Throughout this portion of the test, you may refer to <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html>
//! and other docs about iterators. You may NOT look up specific implementations for these problems
//! in Rust or any other Functional language.
//!
//! If you find that you simply cannot write these methods in the functional style using iterator
//! methods, writing them in the imperative style with loops will still earn partial credit.
